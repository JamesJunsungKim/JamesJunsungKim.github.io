<h1 class="main-title">Problems I've faced that made me contemplate for a while</h1>

<div class="problem-element">
    <div class="problem-element-title">iOS Local Notification for different time settings</div>
    
    <div class="problem-element-description-question">Situation</div>
    <div class="problem-element-description-answer">I wanted to create a feature that allows a user to set a notification triggered from a past time with variety of reoccuring rules</div>

    <div class="problem-element-description-question">Cause</div>
    <div class="problem-element-description-answer">Apple provides UNCalendarNotificationTrigger, UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger, and UNLocationNotificationTrigger
        but any combination of those didn't seem to create the best solution to the problem I had.
        <br>
        For example, a user wants to create an notification that triggers a notification every month from January 31 2018.
        <br>
        Since there are certain months that don't have 31 so I couldn't just create DateComponent(day: 31) and use UNCalendarNotificationTrigger for this matter.
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-element-description-question">Solution</div>
    <div class="problem-element-description-answer">I realized by this point that I can't use the trigger with repeats value being true. 
        <br>
        I changed my approach to this and decided to create 10 notifications whenever a user launches the app. 
        <br>
        A flow would be like, a user launches the app -> Remove 10 notifications and create 10 notifications based on the status of the last notification.
    </div>
