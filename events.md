## [iOS] Try! Swift TOKYO 2019

* Dates: March 21st ~ 22nd 2019 
* Interesting speech:  Discover memory leak with Testcase, In defence of Core Data
* How I felt about the conference: It was cool to meet numerous developers from all around the world, but the content of all speeches didn't turn out to be very pracitcal enough to get implemented in a real project
* I'm wondering if I would like to go the next meetup. I might, just for the fun of haning out with them!
