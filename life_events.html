                <div class="life-event-element-description">- I've been greately interested in machin learning area, after feeling that there are natural restrictions from a mobile development. For example, users prefer OCR to calcualte bowling scores instead of inserting every score by themselves.</div>

                <div class="life-event-element-description">- Even though I don't have high level of knowledge about machin learning but it was awesome having a conversation with AI developers. I learned their journeys on how they started their careers and what problems they were trying to solve.

            <div class="life-event-element-description">- Funny thing is, I participated in this club in order to work with a designer but the designer assigned to my team ended up getting loose since he got fired from his job.
                <br>
                - I was forced to finalize the design of last few scenes by myself. Kind of contradicted my original intention of joining this club but things happen.
                <br>
                - I couldn't just wait for him to do his parts forever so I just did the left jobs in order to get it done.
            </div>

                <div class="life-event-element-question">How it did go?</div>
                <div class="life-event-element-description">
                    - Just attending it by itself was interesting because I've never atteneded a meetup that accommodates more than 800 people, especially all of them were iOS developers.
                    <br>
                    - I got a chance to talk to people I've followed on Twitter or Youtube for the longest time.
                    <br>
                    - The chosen topics weren't really practical in daily work but interesting enough to make me stick around.

                    <br>
                    2) I ended up having a discussion about what's a right way to do a unit test at the party. Best party ever I've had.
